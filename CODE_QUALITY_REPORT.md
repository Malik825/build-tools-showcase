# Code Quality Report

## Initial Linting Errors/Warnings

Initially, the project had several linting errors and warnings. The following are some of the issues identified by ESLint:

1. **Unused Variables:** Several variables were declared but not used.
2. **Missing Semicolons:** Some lines of code were missing semicolons.
3. **Incorrect Spacing:** Inconsistent spacing around operators and in function declarations.
4. **Undefined Variables:** Some variables were used before they were defined.
5. **Improper Import/Export:** Some modules had improper import/export statements.

## Resolving Issues

### Unused Variables

- **Action Taken:** Removed or used the declared variables.
- **Example:**
  ```typescript
  let unusedVariable; 
  ```

### Missing Semicolons

- **Action Taken:** Added semicolons where they were missing and needed.
- **Example:**
  ```typescript
  let variable = 'value'; 
  ```

### Incorrect Spacing

- **Action Taken:** Fixed spacing issues using Prettier.
- **Example:**
  ```typescript
  let variable = 'value'; 
  ```

### Undefined Variables

- **Action Taken:** Ensured all variables were properly defined before use.
- **Example:**
  ```typescript
  let definedVariable = 'value'; 
  ```

### Improper Import/Export

- **Action Taken:** Corrected import/export statements.
- **Example:**
  ```typescript
  import { Tool } from './models/types'; 
  ```

## Final Linting Results

After addressing the initial issues, the project now passes all ESLint checks. The codebase is free from linting errors and warnings, ensuring a higher standard of code quality.

## Continuous Improvement

- **Pre-commit Hook:** A pre-commit hook is set up to run linting and formatting checks before each commit, ensuring code quality is maintained.
- **Regular Reviews:** Regular code reviews are conducted to catch and fix any new issues early in the development process.
